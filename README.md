# Life between humans and nature
This is a C/CPP programming base computer graphics project.
Here I'm try to tell a story, where using C/CPP language and with graphics.h and libbgi.a

## Day by day, human destroy planet.
I'm trying to figure out that in my project. But I have not enough resource and not have so much time. So I'm use less resource and try to easy and understandable with beginners.

#Leave before, have a note
I have not use time for this project. That's why this project haven't ended with story. If you can, then you can end this project and... [Best wishes in advance]
## NOTE[: ]
Before run CPP file, you need to include graphics.h header file and also need to add a library file called lbgi.a [~maybe, not remember right now]

## Discussion
If you have any problem with this code or have any questions nor any additional information. Fork it or can knock me!
